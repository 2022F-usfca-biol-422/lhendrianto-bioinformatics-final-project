# Project goal

The goal of this project is to take Illumina data of SARS-CoV-2 from an SRA bioproject
and produce a report using the given pipeline and code. The goal is to use the skills
accumulated throughout the course of this class.

The link of the SRA bioproject could be found via:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=(txid2697049[Organism:noexp]%20NOT%200[Mbases])%20AND%20bioproject_sra[filter]%20NOT%20bioproject_gap[filter]
